2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mpg2/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mpg2/tmp[1]_i_2/O, cell mpg2/tmp[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mpg3/tmp_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mpg3/tmp[3]_i_3/O, cell mpg3/tmp[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mpg4/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mpg4/tmp[1]_i_2__0/O, cell mpg4/tmp[1]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mpg5/tmp_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mpg5/tmp[3]_i_3__0/O, cell mpg5/tmp[3]_i_3__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT mpg2/tmp[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    op_x/sel_num/tmp_reg[0] {FDRE}
    op_x/sel_num/tmp_reg[1] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT mpg3/tmp[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    op_x/num3_map/tmp_reg[3] {FDRE}
    op_x/num3_map/tmp_reg[2] {FDRE}
    op_x/num3_map/tmp_reg[0] {FDRE}
    op_x/num3_map/tmp_reg[1] {FDRE}
    op_x/num4_map/tmp_reg[2] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT mpg4/tmp[1]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    op_y/sel_num/tmp_reg[0] {FDRE}
    op_y/sel_num/tmp_reg[1] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT mpg5/tmp[3]_i_3__0 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    op_y/num1_map/tmp_reg[2] {FDRE}
    op_y/num1_map/tmp_reg[3] {FDRE}
    op_y/num1_map/tmp_reg[0] {FDRE}
